## Who Am I

My key strengths are personality and creative thinking. I am driven to learn about new technologies, tools, techniques,
and ideas that can be implemented to make workflows more efficient. I strongly believe in the idea of using the "right
tool for the job", and continuing to add to my list of resources helps me creatively solve complex issues in all aspects
of infrastructure design and automation.
