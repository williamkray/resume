## Who Am I

I am an experienced Cloud Engineer, Architect, People Manager, and Director with a positive outlook and people-focused
personality. I strongly believe in using the right tool for the job regardless of the domain, I have strong opinions but
hold them weakly, and I am convinced that most problems arise because of a breakdown in communication rather than
technical reasons. I focus on my people and view the role of a Manager as giving their team every possible opportunity
to succeed without getting in their way. I believe that a person who is tired of learning is tired of life, and I never
want to be that person.

## Where Am I Going

I am exceptionally proud of my career beginnings in retail, the lessons learned there about customer obsession, and my
pivot into the Technology space. I always hope to continue that journey by learning new concepts, staying at the
bleeding edge of technology, and radically changing how people think of and interact with technological systems, all
while enabling the people who work with me to grow their personal and professional skillsets. As people and industries
change their thought processes around the internet, cloud computing, and software, I want to continue to be a guide and
trusted expert to ensure that the next generation of technologists are thinking comprehensively about how to define best
practices, come up with new ideas, and use critical thinking.
